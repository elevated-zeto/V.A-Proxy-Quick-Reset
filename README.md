# V.A-Proxy-Quick-Reset
AHK + batch script combo to quickly restart V.A Proxy

A simple tool to quickly restart V.A Proxy with a button press.
Requires AHK v1. https://www.autohotkey.com/

You might have to change the filepath pointing to the VA_Proxy.exe in ResetVA.bat

To change the hotkey, edit the AHK script. The default bind is "p".

This functionality will most likely be integrated into https://github.com/tairasoul/VAProxy.SpeedrunningUtils/ in the future (in a far more elegant way).

Have fun running :)
